About Me
I am a passionate front-end developer with a strong focus on design and efficient code. My journey started with a love for drawing and designing, which naturally led me into the world of web development. Before my formal education at UKM, I taught myself CSS, PHP, Unity, and React, driven by a desire to bring ideas to life on the web.

I enjoy exploring frameworks like Svelte and React, constantly seeking ways to improve and optimize code for a better developer experience. As a freelancer, I've designed and developed web applications, creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces that meet client needs. My freelance work has sharpened my skills in building custom solutions and tackling various challenges in web design.

Currently, I am focusing on expanding my expertise into mobile application development by learning React Native. I am excited about the endless possibilities and innovations that this path offers!
